Welcome to Fast Maths. This is an interactive maths game. 

A live version of the site can be viewed from here.

Here is a mock-up image of Speed Maths interactive game, using the "Am I Responsive" site.

## UX Design
### Wireframes

My wireframe was created using Balsamiq. Here are screenshots of the wireframes:

### Colour Scheme

I used the UX Design section of Adobe Color [https://color.adobe.com/trends/Ui/ux] to identify the most current user friendly colour palates available. I also looked at their game design section of Adobe Colour [https://color.adobe.com/trends/Game-design]. I noticed that there was an abundance of dark purple in both sections, so I chose a dark purple based colour palate. I then checked this palate using WebAIM contrast checker [https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/], and made the shades lighter and darker to ensure I had a colour scheme that included a number of high contrast pairings. The palate was created by Adobe Colour and contained the following colours:

#7fffd4 - aquamarine  #084A5C - dark teal  #1F0229 - dark purple #FFFF00 - yellow

### Fonts

I selected the fonts for this project from Google Fonts.

Having looked at a number of quiz type phone games, I decided that the title font should be a bit different, to catch the eye of the user. I chose the Luckiest Guy font.

The font used for the numbers needs to be really clear to read, but still eyecatching. The numbers should look as interesting as possible, whilst maintaining clarity. I chose Kaushan Script for this purpose.

On the other hand, the font used for the explanation needs to be very easy to read, or users won't bother to read it! I chose Quicksand for this purpose.

Whilst looking through fonts, I discovered Noto Color Emoji font, which I decided to use for my game graphics.
