Welcome to Fast Maths. This is an interactive maths game. 

A live version of the site can be viewed from here.

A mock-up image of Speed Maths interactive game, using the "Am I Responsive" site can be viewed [here.](https://amiresponsive.co.uk/)

## UX Design
### Wireframes

My wireframe was created using [Balsamiq.](https://balsamiq.com/) Here are screenshots of the wireframes:

### Colour Scheme

I used the UX Design section of [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/trends/Ui/ux) to identify the most current user friendly colour palates available. I also looked at their game [design section](https://color.adobe.com/trends/Game-design) of Adobe Colour. I noticed that there was an abundance of dark purple in both sections, so I chose a dark purple based colour palate. I then checked this palate using [WebAIM contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/), and made the shades lighter and darker to ensure I had a colour scheme that included a number of high contrast pairings. The palate was created by Adobe Colour and contained the following colours:

#7fffd4 - aquamarine  #084A5C - dark teal  #1F0229 - dark purple #FFFF00 - yellow

### Fonts

I selected the fonts for this project from [Google Fonts.](https://fonts.google.com/) Having looked at a number of quiz type phone games, I decided that the title font should be a bit different, to catch the eye of the user. I chose the [Luckiest Guy](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Luckiest+Guy?query=luckiest+guy) font. The font used for the numbers needed to be really clear to read, but still eyecatching. The numbers should look as interesting as possible, whilst maintaining clarity. I chose [Kaushan Script](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Kaushan+Script?query=Kaushan+Script) for this purpose. The font used for the explanation needs to be very easy to read, or users won't bother to read it! I chose [Quicksand](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quicksand?query=quicksand) for this purpose.

### Improvements Made After Initial Testing Phase

This project has been one of constant testing and improving.
Here are some of the most notable improvements:
- After the initial build I had to add functions to make sure it was only possible to select one timer once.
- I used calc() to make sure each page stretched to the bottom of the screen.
- I added a welcome page to ensure consistency throughout the site.
- I have persistently refined and improved the javaScript, even after it was working well, because it was (and still is) much longer than I would like it to be.
